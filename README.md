# Josh's PreWork Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was learning how to build a basic webpage.
- I built this project in order to understand the key concepts we'll be learning on the coding bootcamp course over the following 16 weeks.
- This allows me to be introduced to the key initial concepts and allows us as students to get straight into learning in what is quite a condensed short form course.
- I learnt how to do basic structuring of a webpage in HTML, How to use CSS to add style to that webpage so it looks visually appealing, How to use javascript to create an element of interactivity with the webpage although only to the extent that it currently  shows up in the console, and how to incoporate git into my workflow and use push and pull requests to make coding changes without affecting live versions of a site.

## Usage

This prework study guide can be used to see a few of the concepts i have learnt in the building of this webpage.
Chiefly it has sections for each of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript each of which have a few bullet points of things i have learnt in them.
The user can also use chrome developer tools to open the browser console to see javascript running and be suggested a random topic to study first.
